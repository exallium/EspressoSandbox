# Espresso Sandbox

Small Example app for utilizing Espresso.  The intention of this app is to show
people how to get started quickly with Espresso and Gradle, and I hope to keep
this up to date with the latest version of the libraries.

Espresso is a UI Automation test framework for Android from Google:

https://code.google.com/p/android-test-kit/

Note that in order to run tests, you must use the command line:

```
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest
```

And of course have a device connected.  You might also need to unlock your device.
Needing to use the command line is because of a known intellij issue.
